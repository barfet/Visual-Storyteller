1. Project Overview: Visual Storyteller

Objective:
Build an application that:
	•	Step 1: Accepts an image (uploaded by a user or from a sample dataset).
	•	Step 2: Uses a pre‑trained image captioning model (e.g., BLIP, or a Hugging Face captioning model) to generate a short, descriptive caption.
	•	Step 3: Passes the caption to an LLM (via OpenAI’s GPT‑3.5/4 or an open‑source alternative) to generate an extended, creative narrative/story.
	•	Step 4 (Optional): Converts the narrative into speech using a TTS engine (e.g., Amazon Polly, gTTS, or a local TTS library).
	•	Step 5: Exposes the entire workflow via a REST API (using FastAPI or Flask) and deploys it to the cloud (AWS/GCP) to simulate production‑grade performance.

2. Tech Stack & Environment Setup

Programming Language & Frameworks:
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	FastAPI (or Flask) for API endpoints.
	•	Hugging Face Transformers & Diffusers: For image captioning and (if desired) for any image generation/stylization.
	•	OpenAI API (or an equivalent LLM service) for narrative generation.
	•	TTS Libraries: For instance, gTTS or Amazon Polly SDK.
	•	Docker: For containerization and deployment.
	•	Cloud Provider: AWS Lambda with API Gateway or a GCP Cloud Run container.

Installation Example (requirements.txt):

fastapi
uvicorn
transformers
torch
Pillow
requests
gtts
python-dotenv

Add additional packages as needed (e.g., boto3 for AWS Polly, or diffusers for image generation).

4. Detailed Implementation Steps

Step 4.1: Image Captioning Module

Objective:
Take an input image and generate a descriptive caption.

Example using a pre‑trained model from Hugging Face (e.g., BLIP):

models/captioning.py

from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration

# Initialize the BLIP model and processor
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

def generate_caption(image_path: str) -> str:
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")
    out = model.generate(**inputs)
    caption = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return caption

# For testing:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    caption = generate_caption("data/sample_images/example.jpg")
    print("Caption:", caption)

Step 4.2: Narrative Generation Module

Objective:
Use the caption as a prompt to generate a creative narrative using an LLM.

models/narrative.py

import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Loads your OPENAI_API_KEY from a .env file
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def generate_narrative(caption: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"Based on the following image description, write an engaging, creative narrative:\n\n\"{caption}\"\n\nNarrative:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or "gpt-4" if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    narrative = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return narrative

# For testing:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_caption = "A serene landscape with mountains in the background and a calm lake in the foreground."
    narrative = generate_narrative(sample_caption)
    print("Narrative:", narrative)

Step 4.3: TTS Service Module (Optional)

Objective:
Convert the generated narrative to speech.

services/tts_service.py

from gtts import gTTS
import os

def text_to_speech(text: str, output_filename: str = "output.mp3") -> str:
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(output_filename)
    return output_filename

# For testing:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "This is a sample narrative converted into speech."
    audio_file = text_to_speech(sample_text)
    print(f"Audio saved as: {audio_file}")

Step 4.4: API Endpoint with FastAPI

Objective:
Expose the entire workflow as a REST API.

app.py

import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse, FileResponse
import shutil
import uuid
from models.captioning import generate_caption
from models.narrative import generate_narrative
from services.tts_service import text_to_speech

app = FastAPI()

UPLOAD_DIR = "data/sample_images"
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_DIR, exist_ok=True)

@app.post("/process_image/")
async def process_image(file: UploadFile = File(...), tts: bool = False):
    # Save the uploaded image
    file_extension = file.filename.split(".")[-1]
    unique_filename = f"{uuid.uuid4()}.{file_extension}"
    file_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, unique_filename)
    
    with open(file_path, "wb") as buffer:
        shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)
    
    try:
        # Step 1: Generate a caption
        caption = generate_caption(file_path)
        
        # Step 2: Generate a narrative using the caption
        narrative = generate_narrative(caption)
        
        response_data = {
            "caption": caption,
            "narrative": narrative,
        }
        
        # Step 3: Optionally convert narrative to speech
        if tts:
            audio_filename = f"audio_{uuid.uuid4()}.mp3"
            audio_file_path = os.path.join("data", audio_filename)
            text_to_speech(narrative, audio_file_path)
            response_data["audio_file"] = audio_filename
        
        return JSONResponse(content=response_data)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/audio/{audio_filename}")
def get_audio(audio_filename: str):
    audio_file_path = os.path.join("data", audio_filename)
    if os.path.exists(audio_file_path):
        return FileResponse(audio_file_path, media_type="audio/mpeg")
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Audio file not found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

5. Advanced Features & Experimentation

Once the core pipeline is working, you can extend the project with the following ideas:
	•	Image Stylization or Enhancement:
Integrate a style transfer or diffusion‑based model to modify the input image based on the narrative’s mood. For example, use the Stable Diffusion pipeline to generate an artistic reinterpretation of the original image.
	•	Enhanced Prompt Engineering:
Refine the LLM prompt by including additional context (e.g., “Write a narrative that evokes the feeling of nostalgia…”). Experiment with temperature and max‑token settings to vary creativity.
	•	Multi‑Modal Feedback:
Enable users to upload additional images or select different narrative styles, storing results in a database for later retrieval or A/B testing.
	•	Evaluation & Logging:
Log request/response pairs to monitor output quality. Optionally, integrate a simple evaluation pipeline to compare generated narratives against a set of curated examples.

6. Deployment on the Cloud

To simulate a production‑grade environment, consider these deployment steps:
	1.	Containerization:
Create a Dockerfile for your application.

FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]


	2.	Deploying:
	•	AWS: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Fargate, or Lambda with API Gateway.
	•	GCP: Use Cloud Run or App Engine.
	•	CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

7. Final Deliverables & Documentation
	•	GitHub Repository:
Include all source code, a detailed README with setup, testing, and deployment instructions, and sample requests/responses.
	•	Demo Video:
Record a short demo showing how to upload an image, view the caption and narrative, and (if enabled) listen to the generated audio.
	•	Blog/Write-Up:
Consider writing a blog post outlining your design decisions, challenges, and what you learned about integrating CV with generative storytelling and TTS.

Summary

By building the Visual Storyteller project, you will:
	•	Gain hands‑on experience with cutting‑edge image captioning models.
	•	Integrate LLM‑based narrative generation with advanced prompt engineering.
	•	Optionally work with TTS to bring the narrative to life audibly.
	•	Build and deploy a multi‑modal API on the cloud, showcasing your ability to tackle real‑world production constraints.

This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency in computer vision but also your creative and end‑to‑end system design skills—qualities highly valued in both research‑focused and production‑grade roles in the CV domain. Enjoy experimenting and happy coding!
