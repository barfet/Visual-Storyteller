Below is a comprehensive Implementation Guide that combines the product definition, user stories, technical architecture, and step-by-step instructions for building the Visual Storyteller project. This guide is intended to help your development team understand the product vision, technical requirements, and detailed steps for implementation and deployment.

Visual Storyteller Implementation Guide

1. Overview

Visual Storyteller is a multi-modal web application that:
	•	Accepts an image upload from the user.
	•	Generates a caption from the image using a pre-trained computer vision (CV) model.
	•	Creates a creative narrative based on the caption using a Large Language Model (LLM).
	•	Optionally converts the narrative into an audio file via Text-to-Speech (TTS).
	•	Exposes all functionality via a RESTful API built with FastAPI.

Goals:
	•	Demonstrate end-to-end integration of computer vision, language generation, and audio synthesis.
	•	Build a scalable, production-ready system deployable on cloud platforms.
	•	Provide clear APIs and documentation for future maintenance and potential enhancements.

2. Product Definition & User Stories

2.1 Product Description
	•	Features:
	•	Image Upload: Users upload an image file (JPG/PNG).
	•	Captioning: The system automatically generates a caption describing the image.
	•	Narrative Generation: The caption is used to generate an engaging, creative narrative.
	•	TTS (Optional): The narrative is converted to an audio file.
	•	API Endpoints: Endpoints for processing images and retrieving generated audio.
	•	Target Users: Creative professionals, educators, developers, and accessibility advocates.
	•	Benefits: Enhance creativity, improve accessibility, and showcase multi-modal processing.

2.2 User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

User Story 1: Image Upload and Storage
	•	Story: As a user, I want to upload an image file so that it can be processed.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Upload accepts JPG and PNG files.
	•	Image is stored with a unique identifier.
	•	API returns a success response with the image reference.
	•	Test Cases:
	•	Upload valid images and verify unique ID is returned.
	•	Attempt to upload an unsupported file and check for error response.

User Story 2: Image Captioning
	•	Story: As a user, I want a caption generated from my image.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The captioning module processes the image using a pre-trained model.
	•	API response includes a non-empty, descriptive caption.
	•	Test Cases:
	•	Process a known image and validate key descriptive terms appear in the caption.

User Story 3: Narrative Generation
	•	Story: As a user, I want a creative narrative based on the image caption.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Narrative module uses the caption as input for the LLM.
	•	API response contains a coherent and contextually relevant narrative.
	•	Test Cases:
	•	Validate that a narrative is generated from a test caption.
	•	Ensure narrative length and creativity meet specifications.

User Story 4: Optional TTS Conversion
	•	Story: As a user, I want the option to convert the narrative into an audio file.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	When enabled, TTS converts narrative text into an audio file.
	•	The audio file is stored and accessible via the API.
	•	Test Cases:
	•	Enable TTS during processing and verify audio generation.
	•	Retrieve and play the audio file to confirm it is correct.

User Story 5: End-to-End Workflow
	•	Story: As a user, I want the complete flow—from image upload to audio retrieval—to work seamlessly.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The API returns the caption, narrative, and audio reference (if TTS is enabled).
	•	Overall response time is within acceptable limits (e.g., < 5 seconds).
	•	Test Cases:
	•	Simulate the complete workflow and verify all parts of the response.
	•	Measure and verify performance metrics under load.

3. Technical Architecture & Technology Stack

3.1 Architecture Overview

The solution consists of several modules orchestrated by a FastAPI service:
	1.	Client/Frontend: (Optional) A simple UI for testing or API integration.
	2.	API Gateway: FastAPI routes incoming HTTP requests.
	3.	File Storage: Temporary storage for image uploads and generated audio.
	4.	Processing Modules:
	•	Image Captioning Module: Uses a pre-trained model (e.g., BLIP from Hugging Face).
	•	Narrative Generation Module: Uses an LLM (via OpenAI API).
	•	TTS Module: Converts narrative text to audio using gTTS or AWS Polly.
	5.	Logging/Monitoring: Centralized logging of events and errors.

A simplified diagram (text version) is shown below:

os.makedirs(UPLOAD_DIR, exist_ok=True)

def save_uploaded_file(file: UploadFile) -> str:
    file_extension = file.filename.split(".")[-1]
    unique_filename = f"{uuid.uuid4()}.{file_extension}"
    file_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, unique_filename)
    with open(file_path, "wb") as buffer:
        shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)
    return file_path

Image Captioning Module (models/captioning.py)

from PIL import Image
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration

# Load model and processor once at startup
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

def generate_caption(image_path: str) -> str:
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")
    output = model.generate(**inputs)
    caption = processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return caption

Narrative Generation Module (models/narrative.py)

import os, openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Ensure the .env file is loaded
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def generate_narrative(caption: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"Based on the following image description, write an engaging and creative narrative:\n\n\"{caption}\"\n\nNarrative:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Text-to-Speech Module (services/tts_service.py)

from gtts import gTTS

def text_to_speech(text: str, output_filename: str = "output.mp3") -> str:
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(output_filename)
    return output_filename

API Service Layer (app.py)

import os, uuid
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse, FileResponse
from models.captioning import generate_caption
from models.narrative import generate_narrative
from services.tts_service import text_to_speech
from helpers import save_uploaded_file  # If placed in a separate helper file

app = FastAPI(title="Visual Storyteller API")

@app.post("/process_image/")
async def process_image(file: UploadFile = File(...), tts: bool = False):
    file_path = save_uploaded_file(file)
    try:
        caption = generate_caption(file_path)
        narrative = generate_narrative(caption)
        response_data = {"caption": caption, "narrative": narrative}
        if tts:
            audio_filename = f"audio_{uuid.uuid4()}.mp3"
            audio_path = os.path.join("data", audio_filename)
            text_to_speech(narrative, audio_path)
            response_data["audio_file"] = audio_filename
        return JSONResponse(content=response_data)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/audio/{audio_filename}")
def get_audio(audio_filename: str):
    audio_path = os.path.join("data", audio_filename)
    if not os.path.exists(audio_path):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Audio file not found")
    return FileResponse(audio_path, media_type="audio/mpeg")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

5. Deployment & CI/CD

5.1 Docker Containerization

Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

5.2 Cloud Deployment
	•	AWS/GCP:
Deploy the Docker container using:
	•	AWS Fargate / Elastic Beanstalk: Containerize and deploy via ECS.
	•	GCP Cloud Run: Containerize and deploy.
	•	Environment Variables:
Configure production secrets (API keys, storage paths) using your cloud provider’s secrets manager.

5.3 CI/CD Pipeline
	•	GitHub Actions Example:
	•	Set up actions to run tests, lint, build Docker images, and deploy on merges to the main branch.
	•	Use actions for static code analysis (e.g., Black, Flake8).

6. Testing Strategy
	•	Unit Tests:
Write tests for each module using pytest. Mock external API calls for LLM and TTS.
	•	Integration Tests:
Create end-to-end tests simulating the entire workflow.
	•	Performance Tests:
Use tools like Locust or JMeter to ensure API response times are within acceptable limits.

Example Unit Test (pytest):

def test_generate_caption():
    caption = generate_caption("data/sample_images/example.jpg")
    assert isinstance(caption, str) and len(caption) > 0

def test_generate_narrative():
    narrative = generate_narrative("A scenic mountain lake")
    assert "mountain" in narrative.lower()

7. Final Steps & Documentation
	1.	Documentation:
	•	Ensure README.md includes installation, setup, API usage, and deployment instructions.
	•	Use FastAPI’s auto-generated OpenAPI docs (accessible at /docs).
	2.	Demo Video:
Record a short demonstration showing an image upload, caption and narrative generation, and TTS playback.
	3.	Monitoring & Logging:
Integrate logging (e.g., Python logging module, CloudWatch for AWS) and set up error monitoring.
